# MD5 Guys

The final project for a web development class I took during Undergrad. This project was done with a group. I am responsible for the search, add and delete funcionality along with some of the other php files. See below for a breakdown. 
The project resembles a primitive employee management system with a built-in search functionality. This project was to mimic a company that specializes in researching the MD5 hash algorithm. We were tasked with creating an employee information system. We used SQL, HTML, CSS and PHP to create the system.

### Getting Started
**Requirements**
- MySQL Database
- Php5 

### Deployment
To deploy please install a MySQL database. To create the database to work with the project, run the FinalSQL.sql file. This file also contains sample data/logins. 
Install php. Configure the settings/ini file to point to the directory where the php, html and CSS files will live. 

### Versioning
This is the projects final version.
